# ftdigicontrol
Test of controlling binary transmission over HAM radio through Fldigi.

This a Lazarus/Freepascal very early experiment to use Fldigi through its XML-RPC
interface to create an automatic exhange of textual and binary files. It is optimized
for PKS transmission by selected encoding with the shortes code in PSK.

The code is documetet through use of PasDoc comments. A bash script is included for
generating the documentation.
